  // This threw me off because conventionally i've only ever
  // seen arr[index] but, this is basically obj[key] and not arr[index]
  // rooms is an object mapping roomâ€‘IDs (strings) -> room data. for example:
  /*const rooms = {
  "aB3dE1" : {
    players: {
      "XyZ123": { name: "Alice", score: 0 },
      "QwR456": { name: "Bob",   score: 0 }
    },
    round: 0
  },
  "fG7hJ8": {
    players: {somePlayerId: { name: "Charlie", score: 0 }},
    round: 2
  }
  rooms is the object, key is roomId, and it contains player and round, player is an object
  with socket id as key and player data as value, round is a number.
  so lets say you want to access XyZ123's score in room aB3dE1, you would do:
  rooms["aB3dE1"].players["XyZ123"].score; 
  very similar to json, but in javascript object notation.
